- Use openeyes toolkit to process parsed molecules, while keeping new molecule
    objects linked to the kegg atom types by an object

- Use #up and #down tags in the KCF file to attach stereochmistry information
    to bond objects using their OETK

- Use OETK to calculate atom stereochmistry information from bond
    stereochmistry information

- Remake KCF files by backtracking using the original parsed array, adding
    stereocenter tags to necessary molecule
